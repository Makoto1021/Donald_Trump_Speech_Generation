# Donald Trump Speech Generation
NLG project for generating Donald Trump's speech

## Introduction
This is a project for generating a pseudo- speech text by US President Donald Trump, using Natural Language Generation(NLG) technology. NLG is one of the fields of Natural Language Processing(NLP). 

## Data structure
Training data is a txt. file which is a concatenated text of 100 speech transcripts of Donald Trump during his presidential election campaign. The training data contains 328394 words, and validation data contains 59472 words.

## Model
The model used in this project is a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM). LSTM is one of the Recurrent Neural Networks and it performs well for generating texts taking into account the contexts.
