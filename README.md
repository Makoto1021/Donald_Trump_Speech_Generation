# Donald Trump Speech Generation
NLG project for generating Donald Trump's speech

## Introduction
This is a project for generating a pseudo- speech text by US President Donald Trump, using Natural Language Generation(NLG) technique. NLG is one of the fields of Natural Language Processing(NLP). 

## Data structure
Input data is a txt. file which is a concatenated transcripts of 64 speeches that Donald Trump delivered during his presidential election campaign in 2016. We split the data into the training data, which contains 328394 words, and validation data containing 59472 words.

## Model
The model used in this project is an Recurrent Neural Networks(RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) units. LSTM performs well for generating texts taking into account the contexts.

## Results
